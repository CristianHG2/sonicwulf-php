# sonicwulf-php
Repository of the SonicWulf 3 PHP framework

Depracated repository. The fourth version is done, it was moved to BitBucket but not stable enough to be released to the public yet.

**If you came looking to make sure that the framework was in fact made by CSHS students, then here's your proof :)**
